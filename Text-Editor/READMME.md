A basic **Text Editor** built using Python's `tkinter` library. This lightweight editor allows users to create, open, and save text files conveniently.  

üìÅ This project is part of the [Mini-Python-Projects](https://github.com/mudasirmurtaza/Mini-Python-Projects) repository and is located in the **Text Editor** folder.  

## Overview  

This **Text Editor** provides essential functionalities such as:  
Creating a **new file** (clears the current text).  
**Opening** an existing `.txt` file.  
**Saving** the file after making edits.  
A simple **menu bar** with file options.  

##  Features  

- **New File**: Clears the text area for fresh content.  
- **Open File**: Loads text from an existing file.  
- **Save File**: Saves the content to a `.txt` file.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalistic design with a menu bar.
